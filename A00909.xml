            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY SONNE EDWARD FITZHERBERT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>INDNES, saith the prouerbe, wil creepe where it can not goe; The meaning is, if I be not deceiued, that such is the force of loue and affection, that when it can not manifest it selfe so amply as it wold, it wil show it selfe in some sort as it may; the which is now verified in me; For, wheras I haue neuer hetherto had the meanes, &amp; oportunity to manifest my affection towards you, by reason of my departure from you and my cuntry, in your infancy, &amp; my continual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence euer since, (for the space of these three and twenty yeres) I can no longer forbeare to geue you some testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my loue, by the particular addresse of this treatise vnto you; For, although I intend it generally to al my cuntrymen, for the publyk good, yet I can not but wish the best part of the benefit to you, to whom the fruite of al my labours is most due, both by a special prerogatiue of nature, and also by the particular priuiledge of my owne desire, and your desert.</p>
            <p>Therfore, to the end you may reape the benefit which I wish you of this treatise, you shal vnderstand, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though part of the subject is policy, yet my meaning is not to animat you to the study, or practise therof, for that in my many yeres trauel, &amp; seruice of forrayne princes, (wherin I haue obserued the successe of many, great
<pb facs="tcp:2397:3"/> negotiations, &amp; bene my selfe emploied in some) I haue learned by experience, that the old prouerb, <hi>Of little med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling commeth great ease,</hi> is verified in nothing more then in matters of state; the practise wherof may wel be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the vse of fire, which though it be most necessary for man, yet is most dangerous to deale with, and doth men some times irreparable dammages, be they neuer so circumspect. And this I say, for that I haue knowne very many stats-men of greate sufficiency, much perplexed, and diuers ruined, not so much by their owne inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as by the difficulties, and dangers incident to the handling of state-matters, which are subiect to infinit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and hazards, impossible to be fore-seene and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, by the witt, or industry of man; And therfore the only point of state, which I wold haue you to learne, or at least to practise, is, to serue God and your prince, with al duty and loyalty, yeelding (as our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth) <hi>To Caesar that vvhich is Caesars;</hi>

               <p n="20">20. But perhapps you wil say that the other law in rewarding and punishing surmounteth this, and represseth it in such sorte that it can haue no force in any wel gouerned commonwelth? Let vs then examine this alitle, and we shal find that the political lawe hath no oddes of this in that point:<note place="margin">The Revvardes the lavv of the flesh propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</note> for this hath also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes and punishmentes as wel as that. The rewardes which this proposeth are diuers, for it promiseth for some thinges, the pleasure and delectation which is sought in the action, with the which, the partie doth thinke him selfe so wel satisfied, that he is contented many times to bestowe much money, yea to venture his life to obteine it. Some times againe it proposeth some gaine or commoditie, which may accompanie or follow the fact. And lastly it findeth meanes other whiles to rob vertue of her reward, and to applie it to it selfe, in so much that there is no remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promised by the political law, wherof the carnal law may not some times giue hope to such as follow it; as I wil make eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the comparison of the one with the other, wherby it shal appeare that the carnal law hath euery where the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p n="21">21.

This was wisely considered by <hi>Plato</hi> in his schollers; For beholding one day a great company of towardly, and notable young men that came to heare his lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he sighed deeply, and said to him selfe; <hi>I feare me that many of these being the seede and children of men,</hi>

For be the councel, plot, &amp; enterprise neuer so prudently contriued, or neuer so wisely, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously, and powerfullie executed, yet if good hap answer not the expectation in the successe, al is in vaine; and which is more, we see often times that many vnaduised and foolish designments succeed very wel,<note place="margin">Foolish design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments succeed vvel many times by chance. <hi>Arist. li. de bona fortuna.</hi> Some borne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat.</note> more by hap (as men commonlie say) then by cunning; which <hi>Aristotle</hi> noteth in such as are horne fortunate; <q>Who (saith he) following the secret impulse &amp; motion of their owne natures and dispositions, haue commonly good and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate successe, yea some times contrarie to al humane reason; in so much that when they deliberate much, and rather follow discourse of reason, then their owne inclination, they loose their good fortune, and haue il successe; wherupon groweth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe,<note place="margin">An old prouerb, fortune fauoreth fooles.</note>

                  <hi>diligentia es la madre de buena ventura,</hi> diligence is the mother of good hap; which yet is so to be vndrestood, that although those commonly speed the best, which vse the best &amp; wisest meanes;<note place="margin">No man can vvarrant the good successe of his designments.</note> yet no man can either by any industrie, or humane wisdome, warrant the good successe of his designments, for that so variable and infinite are the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and suddaine chances which daily occurre in mens affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that no wit of man can fore-see them, &amp; much lesse preuent them; God hauing so ordained (for his owne greater glorie) to check the pride and presumption of man, lest if he had as wel the euent and successe of his plots in his owne power, as the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, he would not knowe him selfe, nor acknowledge any dependance vpon his wil; therfore some times it seemeth good to his diuine wisdome, to ouerthrowe and delude the highest policies, and deepest deuises of men, by such meanes as they least expected, and could neuer imagine, which I wil shewe by sundrie examples. But for asmuch as men commonly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute al suddaine accidents, and vnexpected euents, either to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and chance, or to fate, to the derogation aswel of Gods prouidence, as of the freedome of mans wil; I craue thy patience (good reader) whilest for the better explication of this matter, I say somwhat here by the way of <hi>Fortune, Chance, and Fate,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE in the last chapter declared the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the best Philosophers concerning <hi>Fortune, Chance,</hi> and <hi>Fate,</hi> and proued that though they taught some thinges casual and accidental; yet they acknowledged with al, both the libertie of mans wil, and also the supereminent power of Gods prouidence, And now in this chapter I wil breefly shew howe the same agreeth with our Christian Catholike faith, and debate some other thinges pertaining to this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>S.

                  <hi>vve Christians</hi> (saith hee) <hi>doe not affirme that those causes which are said to proceede of fortune, are no causes at al, but that they are secret and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>linguam corrigat, let him hold his opinion, and correct his speach.</hi> Thus farre S.

                  <note place="margin">Grego. Hom. 10. in Euang. luc.</note> which they held to be his fate, or destiny, addeth these words: <hi>Sed absit a cordibus fidelium &amp;c. But let it be farre from thr harts of Christianes to thinke or say
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2397:83"/> that any thinge is fate or destiny; for he only who created man gouerneth his life; and man vvas not made for the starres, but the starres for man; And therfore if the starres vvere the fate or destiny of man, it should follow, that man should be subiect to those thinges, vvhich are ordayned for his seruice;</hi> Thus saith <hi>S.

In which respect also <hi>S. Augustine</hi> reiecteth the name of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Augustin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth the very name of fortune as not to be vsed of Christians.</note> so farre disallowinge the vse therof, that in his later daies, when he censured al his workes and writings, he retracted the same in a booke of his written when he was a young man, &amp; newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Christian, wherof he saith thus.</p>

                  <hi>It displeaseth me that in that worke I named Fortune so oft, though I meant not therby any goddesse, but the accidental euent of thinges, vvher vpon these vvords are commonly vsed in speach, perhaps, peraduēture, perchance, &amp;c. al which neuertheles are to be referred to the deuine prouidence;</hi> Thus saith he to teach vs that it is the duty of Christians, not only to auoid the prophane opinions of the pagans, concerning <hi>fate</hi> and <hi>fortune,</hi> but also their prophane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speach, or writing therof.<note place="margin">The profane vse of the vvords Fate and Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ouer common at these daies.</note> What then would he say if he were now liuing, and saw the writinges of some Christians of no smal estimation, aswel historiographers as others, who not with standing the aboundant matter, and occasion that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which they handle doe offer vnto them, to obserue the course of Gods prouidence; doe seldome or neuer speake therof, but referre al kind of effects and accidents to <hi>fate</hi> or <hi>fortune,</hi> more prophanely then many of the Painyms were wont to doe, in whom a man shal find very pious and religious obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods infinit wisdome, prouidence, and iustice; Truly if <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (I say) were liuing and should see such workes, he would not thinke them fit to be read of Christians.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But now to proceede, and to leaue a parte the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>fate</hi> or destiny, and to speake a litle more of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or <hi>Chance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The effects of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune attributed to God by holy scriptures.</note> according to the sense and doctrine of the holy Scriptures the wisest and most learned Philosophers, (as before I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) called almighty God <hi>Fortune,</hi> acknowledging therby
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2397:84"/> that from his prouidence proceedeth al the variety of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and aduersitie, and al the good and bad successe which the superstition of ignorant men did commonly ascribe to <hi>Fortune.</hi> And although our holy scriptures doe not apply the prophane name of <hi>Fortune</hi> to the in finite maiesty of God, yet they attribute vnto him al the effects therof,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg. cap.</hi> 2.</note> and therfore they say; <hi>Dominus mortificat, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Hereof the Scriptures also doe aford vs infinite examples, by the which the course of Gods most particuler prouidence (in matters that are commonly ascribed to <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>Chance</hi>) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as it were in a glasse,<note place="margin">Al goods impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to man by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> to the eyes of the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who may learne therby how almighty God the author and fountaine of al goodnes, doth impart to men not only the goods which are called, <hi>Bona animi &amp; corporis, The Goods of the body and of the mind</hi> (as knowledge, learning, wisdome, strength, beauty and such like,) but also <hi>Bona fortunae, the goods of fortune,</hi> (as riches dignitie, honour. &amp;c.

And as for the varietie of prosperous and aduerse <hi>Fortune,</hi> the holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res also teach vs, that the same depend wholy vpon the hand and prouidence of almighty God. This we see in <hi>Iob,</hi> most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for a time in his owne person,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.2. &amp; 24.</note> in his wife, children, freends, and substance, and againe for a while most vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and miserable in al, and yet in the end more rich and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous then euer, who in the midst of his miserie and losses, did comfort himselfe with the consideration of <hi>Dominus dedit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus abstulit; Our lord gaue it and our lord hath taken it a way.</hi> wherein it is also to be noted, that the diuel desiring to afflict him, could not touch him or any thing of his, without the particuler ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of almighty God.</p>

               <p n="9">9.

And for as much as al euil consisteth (as <hi>S.

Augustin</hi> also affirmeth, <hi>that the free vvil of man vvas the cause of al the euil in the vvorld</hi>) it shalbe necessary for the clearing of those difficulties, and the explication of this whole matter, to consider two thinges; the one, why almighty God gaue <hi>free vvil</hi> to man; and the other, how it could stand with his mercy and goodnes to suffer man to be tempted, knowing that he would abuse his <hi>free vvil,</hi> and consequently incurre his indignation, and draw vpon him selfe al that misery which since hath fallen vpon him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the first point, to wit, the causes why God gaue <hi>free vvil</hi> to man, though many reasons &amp; causes may be giuen for the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2397:149"/> same, yet I wil content my selfe, with these few following.<note place="margin">VVhy God gaue free vvil to man.</note> First the dignity of mans nature did require it, for seing it pleased al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God not only to create him of an intelligent, and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature, and to his owne Image,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.</note> but also to make him Lord <label type="milestone">

Hereto other reasons might be added; but by these it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth sufficiently, that it was most conuenient for man to haue <hi>free vvil,</hi> not only for the glory of God, and the manifestation of his infinite power, wisdome, iustice, and mercy; but also for the dignity of mans nature and his exceeding great benefit;</p>
               <p n="11">11. And now to speake of the other point proposed, to wit, how it could stand with Gods infinit goodnes to suffer man to be tempted, knowing that he would fal into sinne, misery, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I say first that almighty God did man no iniury therin, in respect that he had giuen him sufficient meanes to ouercome the tēptation of his aduersary with al facillity, if he him selfe would. For as <hi>Eusebius</hi> bishop of <hi>Caesaria</hi> noteth very wel, God gaue not only freewil to man, but also the light of vnderstanding, reason &amp; conscience, euer mouing him to good; wherto he incited him also with the promise of reward for vertue and wel doing, and terrifyed him with threats of punishmēts, in case he should trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse his law; wherto I add that he was also ready to assist him with his grace, if he would haue put his confidence in him, as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> who saith, <hi>Homo sic erat institutus &amp;c. Man vvas so framed and ordayned, that if he had trusted vpon the healp of God, he had ouercome the temptation of the euil angel.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">VVhy it vvas not conuenient that God should hinder the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Adam though he knevv he vvould fal.</note>12. Secondly I say that although almighty God did know that man would abuse freewil to his owne hurt and damnation; yet it was not conuenient that therfore he should exempt and free him from temptation afterwardes, for that, as on the one side temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation had serued man for a notable occasion of merit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of great benefit to him selfe, if he had resisted it (as he

               <p n="13">13. And now to recount some of those goods and benefits which almighty God did foresee would redound vpon mans sinne, and withal to answere the obiection of the <hi>Atheists</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his permission of euil. The first good or benefit may be, that the world it selfe is much more perfect and complete therby;<note place="margin">VVhy God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth sinne &amp; other euils.

                  </note> For although euil being considered in it selfe, is hateful and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; yet being wayghed togeather with al other thinges, which are necessary to the composition of the world, we shal find it to be also cōuenient for the same, for diuers respects. First, for that the very nature and condition of earthly thinges, doth seeme to require a mixture of good and bad; for seeing that in heauen there is nothing but goodnes and felicitie, and in hel nothing but badnes and misery, it was very conuenient that this our terrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial world, which is betwixt both, should in some degree parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of both. To which purpose <hi>S. Augustin</hi> saith, that God hath made 3. habitations, or mansions, to wit, the highest, the lowest, and one in the midst, wherof the two extreames are altogeather contrary, and the other in the midst hath a great affinity or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with both the extreames.</p>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2397:151"/> he should permit the oppositiō of euil to God, to the end that the good might therby become more prespicuous, eminent, &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,<note place="margin">Arist problem.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING declared by some probable reasons, how it stood with the prouidence and infinit goodnes of almighty God, to permit man to fal into sinne and misery, I wil now satisfie the other difficulties, concerninge the affliction of good men, and the prosperity of wicked men, and shew, that the same are the proper effects sometimes of his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2397:157"/> iustice, and sometimes of his mercy, and that with al they are manifest arguments, of his prouidence in humane affaires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therfore, wheras tribulation seemeth to be, as it were, the proper patrimony and portion of good men,<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>33.</hi> Tribulation the patrimony of good men.</note> for <hi>Multae sunt tribulationes iustorum</hi> (saith the roial prophet) <hi>the afflictions of the iust are many</hi> (as it may appeare by the liues of al the best beloued seruants, and saints of God, yea and of our Sauiour him selfe) it is to be vnderstood, that God hath of his infinit wisdome so ordained it, for many notable reasons, wherof I wil here lay downe diuers, aswel for the consolation of the afflicted, as for the proofe of the matter in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. First wheras the frailty of mans nature is such that no man is so free from sinne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Ioan. 1.</hi> God purgeth the sinnes of good men vvith tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affliction in this life. <hi>Chris. concione 4. ca. 16. ex Luca. Tom. 2.</hi>
                  </note> but that he offendeth almighty God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more or lesse (for as S. Ihon saith <hi>Si dixerimus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If we say we haue no sinne, we seduce and deceaue our selues and there is no trueth in us</hi>) God of his mercy purgeth the sinns of his seruants with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral afflictions in this life, to the end he may reward their good workes with eternal glory in the next. For as <hi>S. Chrisostome</hi> saith, <hi>Iusti afflicti hic purgantur, &amp; in alia vita maiorem merentur gloriam; Iust men being afflicted in this life are purged, and deserue greater glory in the other life.</hi> For this cause, the holy King and prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> paied the penalty of his homycide and addultry by the death of 3. of his children, and the rebellion of one of them,<note place="margin">2. Reg. ca. 11.12.13.15.16.17.18.</note> to wit <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> and by many other afflictions vntil Gods iustice was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, good men are sometimes afflicted in this life,<note place="margin">Good men are somtymes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offences. <hi>2. Reg. ca. 12. Ioan. 9.</hi>
                  </note> for some offences of their fathers, or of some of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, as the innocent infant of <hi>K. Dauid</hi> died in the cradle for his fathers sinne, and for this cause, the <hi>Apostles</hi> asked our Sauiour whether the blind man whome he cured, was borne blind for his fathers sinnes or no. And how it standeth with the iustice of God to punish one for the sinnes of an other,<note place="margin">Chap. 17. nu. 24.25. &amp;c. Chap. nu. 13.14. &amp;c.</note> as the father for the sonne, or the subiect for the prince, I haue partly declared before, and wil declare more amply after a while.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, God suffereth good men sometimes to fal into diuers tentations and troubles to shew them the imbecility of humane nature, lest otherwaies they might forget them selues,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2397:158"/> by reason of the spiritual gifts and graces,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Fourthly if the seruants of God should alwaies liue in prosperity, many would thinke that they embraced vertue and serued God for temporal reward, wheras being in aduersity and misery, they make it manifest that they loue and serue him for him selfe,<note place="margin">The vertue of good men is made manifest to the vvorld by their affliction. Iob. ca. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> and for the discharge of their duties, as appeared by the example of <hi>Iob</hi> whome the diuel did calumniat saying to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; <hi>That Iob did not serue him for nothinge, or in vaine, seeing he did blesse and protect him, his family and al his substance; but touch him</hi> (saith he) <hi>a litle in his welth and possessions, and thou shalt see he wil curse thee;</hi> neuertheles when God had giuen the diuel leaue to afflict him, not only in his substance and children, but also in his owne person, it then appeared that he had not serued God for temporal respects, but for the duty that a creature oweth to his Creator. For he blessed &amp; thanked him, as wel for his losses and afflictions, as for his welth and prosperity saying: <hi>Dominus dedit</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>Our Lord gaue it and our Lord hath taken it away, the name of our Lord be blessed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Fiftly wheras almighty God doth for his owne glory and the edification of others,<note place="margin">Hovv the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous vvorkes of many good men redound vvholy to Gods glory by their afflictions. Good men are persecuted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of their persecutours. Mar. ca. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> worke many times great miracles by his seruants, he suffereth them to indure many temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the end that the infirmity of humane nature appearing therby in them, the glory of their great graces, workes, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, may redound wholy to him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sixtly God suffereth his seruants to be troubled and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the conuersion or confusion of their persecutours his enemies, to the end, that if they wil not be conuerted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and patience of his seruants may serue for a testimony against them, and therefore our Sauiour said to his disciples of their persecutors: <hi>You shal be beaten in their sinagogs, and shal stand before Presidents and Kinges for me; In testimonium illis, For a testimony against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Seauenthly, God permitteth the tribulation of the best &amp;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2397:158"/> iustest men, for the example and consolation of the weaker,<note place="margin">God permitteth the tribulation of the best men, for the example and consolation of the vveaker that are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>Tobiae ca. 2.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. For this cause God suffered the good <hi>Tobias</hi> to be stroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken blind. <hi>Vt posteris</hi> (saith the scripture) <hi>daretur exemplum patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae eius, sicut &amp; sancti Iob; That an example might be giuen to the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as wel of his patience, as of the patience of the holy Iob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca li de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. ca. 6.</note> This also <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> the painim philosopher seemed to consider, saying: <hi>VVhy doe good men suffer much aduersity? Vt alios pati doceant nati sunt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplare; That they may teach others to suffer, for they are borne and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to serue for patterns and examples to other men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Eyghtly; when euil men see good men suffer many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miseries,<note place="margin">Hovv the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good men, may moue euil men to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> and therby vnderstand that they are of no more diuine nature then them selues, but subiect as wel as they to al humayne infirmities, they may also perceaue that it is not impossible for them to imitate their vertues, if they wil vse the same meanes that they doe to attaine thereto.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Ninthly; the patience, fortitude, charity, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of good men, are by their afflictions made knowne not only to the world (for Gods greater glory and their comenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but also to them selues for their owne spiritual comfort, as <hi>S. Augustin</hi> noteth very wel; For vntil they were tried,<note place="margin">Aug. li de ciuit dei ca. 9. <hi>Good men by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, haue tryal and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their ovvne valor and vertu.</hi> Seneca de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sola ad Marcian. li. 1. ca 6. &amp; de prouiden. ca. 4.

To which purpose <hi>Seneca</hi> faith that euen as the good pilott and mariner can not shew his art and skil when he hath a prosperous wind and calme sea, but in tempests and stormes; euen so the good man can not shew his vertue nor yet haue any proofe of him selfe in continual prosperity, but in the difficulties, trauerses, and crosses of aduersities.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For this cause tribulation is compared in the scripture to the fornace, wherein gold is tried, <hi>Tanquam aurum</hi> (faith the boke of wisdome) <hi>In fornace probauit cos, God did trie his seruants like gold in the fornace.</hi> And to the same purpose <hi>Seneca</hi> also saith: <hi>Ignis aurum probat, miseria fortes viros: Fier trieth gold, and misery men of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi> And speaking other where to the prosperous man that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer passed this trial he saith. <hi>I iudge thee to be miserable because thou
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2397:159"/> didst neuer suffer misery;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senell. de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiden. ca. 3. &amp; 4. He is miserable vvhich neuer suffered misery.</note>
                  <hi>hast thou past thy life with out contradiction? neither thus thy selfe nor any man else knowes what thou art able to doe, for to the end that a man may know him selfe, it is necessary that experience teach him his owne ability.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Seneca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Thenthly we learne by the tribulation of good men, that there is an other life after this wherin vertue is rewarded and vice punished;<note place="margin">The tribulation of good men, is an euident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the imortality of the soule. <hi>Cicero de fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>

               <p n="15">15. Seeing then vertue of her owne nature depriueth men of the pleasures and commodities of this world, and that also vertuous men are many times by Gods special ordinance loaden with afflictions during their liues, euen natural reason teacheth that there is an other life after this, wherin they are to receiue the reward of their vertue;<note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Furthermore God permitteth his seruants to be afflicted sometimes with many temporal losses, to the end to take from
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2397:159"/> them the occasions and matter that engendreth or nourisheth vice and sinne, as riches, honour,<note place="margin">The afflictions of good men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth them from the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sinne. <hi>1. Timo. ca. 6.</hi>
                  </note> and other worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which make men forget both God and them selues; and therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Qui volunt fieri diuites, incidunt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Those vvhich desire to become rich, doe fal into temptation, and into the snare of the diuel, and into many vnprofitable and hurtful desires vvhich cast men headlong into perdition.</hi> Thus saith the Apostle.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This also the very painims saw and acknowledged, <hi>Hast thou lost</hi> (saith Seneca) <hi>thy substance and vvelth?</hi>

And here I can not omit an other notable consideration of his, cōcerning the great patience of God towards sinners, which he wisheth al men to propose as an example to them selues, therby to moderate their exorbitant passions of anger and desire of reuenge; <hi>For if</hi> (saith he) <hi>vvise men are vvont oftentymes to cal to

               <p n="6">6. But if we extend the example of Gods patience a litle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the pardon and remission of iniuries done vnto vs (as God pardoneth our iniuries &amp; offences done vnto him) we shal make this consideration much more Christian and proffitable to vs,<note place="margin">Gods patiente to be imitated in remission of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries <hi>Mat. ca. 18.</hi>
                  </note> especially seeing our owne pardon dependeth vpon our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of almighty God in this point, as we may learne by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours parable of the maister of the family, who hauing remitted al the debt of his seruant, greeuously punished him afterwards, because he did not pardon his fellow, as he was pardoned him selfe. Therfore I conclude with <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyp. li de bone patient.</note> that seeing almighty God (who is both our Lord and Father) is the author and true mircour of patience, it is fit that we imitate him therin, <hi>For ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants</hi> (saith <hi>S.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2397:171"/> for whome eternal felicitie is ordayned other where, there might seeme to be some more reason of a diuine prouidence therin; but seeing al temporal good and euil is indifferent, and common to good and bad men, and that the good are many tymes punished togeather with the bad, and that some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are punished here and others not; of what other cause (say they) may al this seeme to proceede then of meere chance? which as they suppose guideth the affayres of men.</p>

                  </note> I say that the same hath bin sufficiently considered hertofore, of such as haue neuertheles acknowledged and taught the particuler prouidence of God ouer men, as namely the Preacher who saith in <hi>Ecclesiasticus:</hi> that amongst many vanities of vncertaine euents which he obserued in the world; the worst is, <hi>that many tymes there hapneth to the iust, that vvhich the wicked deserue,</hi>

                  </note> wherin he denieth not Gods iust iudgment and prouidence ouer men (which he plainly teacheth in the same place saying, <hi>that the vvorkes of iust and vvise men are in the hands of God</hi>) but signifieth that the wicked take occasion by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and vncertayne euents of thinges, to thinke (as <hi>S.

In al which cases and diuers other (whereof I haue also spoken before) it is to be vnderstood, that innocent men may be afflicted, &amp; yet not punished, though neuertheles others may be iustly punished in them. And the reason is for that the calamity of one person may haue many different considerations, according to the difference of Gods iudgements vpon him that is afflicted,<note place="margin">Hovv the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one man vvhich is no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to him may be a puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment to others.

As for example; the suddain death of some one (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hap by Gods special ordinance for the saluation of his soule, or only by natural or casual meanes) may by the secret disposition, and prouidence of God, serue for a due punishment to his parents, for temporal reward (due also by Gods iustice) to his enemies, for an example, and admonition to some, for an edification to others, and finnally for the glory of God; and this <hi>S. Augustine</hi> insinuateth notably, saying. <hi>For as much as the visible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or deaths of men may be either profitable, or hurtful to those vpon vvhome they are inflicted, our Lord knovveth in his secret prouidence hovv to dispose the same iustly to euery one; Etiam cum aliorum peccata in alijs vlcisci videtur; euen then vvhen he seemeth to punish the sinnes of some in others.</hi> Thus saith <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Now then of these premisses I gather three conclusions. The first is,<note place="margin">The first conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion gathered of the premisses.</note> that one man may iustly beare the temporal penalty of an other mans faults, either in respect of some interest or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety which one may haue in an other, or of some coniunction, or communion in nature (for both which respects children are punished for the sinnes of their parents) or els by reason of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural simpathy in a politicke body (as when whole common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welths are afflicted for the offences of some members thereof) in which cases there is a iust participation of merit and demerit, and consequently of reward and punishment.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The second conclusion,<note place="margin">The second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> is that in the afflictions as wel of whole communities, as of particuler men, for the sinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, God disposeth, and distributeth the same to euery one in such weight, measure, and manner, as to his infinit wisdome seemeth conuenient for the punishmēt of some, &amp; benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; his owne glory, reseruing the reasons, &amp; causes therof,

And herein also it is to be considered, that God sheweth his mercy and prouidence towards man, as wel in concealing the one from him, as in reuealing vnto him the other, for as by the light and knowledge which we haue of his iudgements in general, we are moued the more to admire his infinit wisdome, to acknowledge his prouidence, and to honour and loue him: so by not knowing his iudgements concerning our selues in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, we are admonished of our owne infirmity &amp; ignorance, and of our absolut dependance vpon his wil,<note place="margin">Not fit for the slaue to knovv the councels of his Lord and maister. <hi>Ioan. ca. 15.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Seeing then true wisdome is, according to the opinion both of philosophers and diuines, an especial gift of almighty God, it must needes follow that it can haue no communication

               </p>
               <p n="7">7 This wil be more euident by the consideration of what wisdome is,<note place="margin">VVhat vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, vvherin it consisteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our holy scriptures. <hi>Iob. ca. 28.</hi>
                  </note> and wherin it principally consisteth. Therfore first to speake of the doctrine of our holy scriptures, and after of the opinion of Philosophers; <hi>Iob</hi> hauing asked this question; <hi>VVher is wisdome to be found, and what is the place of vnderstanding?</hi> answereth him selfe saying; <hi>Ecce timor domini ipsa est sapientia &amp; recedere a malo intelligentia; Behould the feare of God is wisdome it selfe, and to forsake euil is vnderstanding.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccli. ca. 19.</note> Thus saith <hi>Iob:</hi> which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher confirmeth sayinge. <hi>Omnis sapientia timor Dei, &amp; in omni sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia dispositio legis; Al wisdome is the feare of God, and in al wisdome is the disposition of the lavv,</hi> That is to say (as we read in the greeke text) <hi>Factio &amp; operatio legis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">True vvisdome consisteth in the feare of God and the execution of his lavv.</note>
                  <hi>The doing and vvorking of the lavve,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiing that al wisdome consisteth in the feare of God, and in the execution of his law, which is as much to say, as in keeping his commandements; wherof three reasons may be giuen.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The first, because he which feareth God and fulfilleth his commandements, hath the ground and principal part of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">The principal part of vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to respect in al thinges the glory of God, and our eternal good. <hi>Matth. 16. Eccli. c. 37.</hi>
                  </note> for in al his actions he principally respecteth two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the one, the glory of God (for the which man and al other creatures were cheefly ordained) and the other, the eternal good of his soule which most importeth him; For as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith. <hi>VVhat doth a man gaine though he get the vvhole vvorld, if he loose his soule?</hi> And therfore the Peacher saith very wel; <hi>Sapiens est animae suae sapiens: He vvhich is vvise, is vvise for his soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The second reason is, for that he which feareth God and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2397:179"/> keepeth his commandements, doth therin worke wisely,<note place="margin">He vvhich truly feareth God is vvise for his temporal good and vvhy.</note> not only for his eternal good (as I said before) but also for his temporal and worldly good: seeing therby he conserueth him selfe in the protection and fauor of him who is the author and giuer as wel of the one, as of the other, and hath a special and particular care of such as feare and serue him, for as the Psalmist saith. <hi>Oculi domini super metuentes eum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.</note>
                  <hi>The eyes of our Lord are vpon them that feare him. Et aures eius in preces eorum; and his eares are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to their praiers:</hi> and such is his loue towards them &amp; the regard he hath of them, that as our Sauiour saith;<note place="margin">Math. ca. <hi>10.</hi> Psal. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>He numbreth the very haires of their heads: Et custodit</hi> (saith the psalmist) <hi>omnia ossa eorum, and preserueth al their bones, to the end that there shal not any one of them perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Therfore as no man either is or can be counted wise or happy, who by contempt of almighty God,<note place="margin">No man is vvise in exposing him selfe to Gods indignation.</note> and breach of his commandements, exposeth him selfe to his indignation (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both he, and his may vtterly perish) so also he which by the feare of God and the obseruation of his law procureth his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fauor and protection, is not only truely wise, but also truely happy: which <hi>Aristotle</hi> him selfe acknowledged,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist. li. 10. ethi. ca 7.</hi> He vvhich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the fauor of God, is both vvise and happy according to Aristotle <hi>Idem. Ibid. ca 8.</hi> The lavv of God is the rule of al prudent actions. The difference betvvixt vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The obiect of vvisdome. The difinition of vvisdome. <hi>Cicero offic li. 2.

               <p n="11">11. The third reason why the feare of God and the keeping of his commandments is true wisdome, is, because the law of God is the true rule, and squire, by the which al prudent actions are to be measured, for it comprehendeth in it selfe &amp; teacheth al true vertue and goodnes, without the which there can be no true prudence: as shal appeare by the circumstances due, and requisit thereto, according to the doctrin of Philosophers; wherein in by the way it is to be noted, that although wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and prudence in common speach are commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, yet there is betwixt them this difference; that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath for her obiect, not only humane, but also diuine things, and therefore is defined both by Philosophers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins to be; <hi>fciencia diuinarum humanarum{que} rerum &amp; eorumquae illarum rerum sunt causae, The knowledge of things diuine, and humane, and of

               <p n="12">12. The 1. is, that the end of euery action be truely good, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth to be the first and principal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance requisite to prudence,<note place="margin">

               <p n="13">13. The 2. circumstance is, not only that the end of euery action be good (as I haue said) but also that the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that end, be correspondent therto, that is to say, that they be also good and iust, yea and wel and iustly done; To which purpose <hi>Aristotle</hi> prescribeth circumstances of due time, place, and manner, to be considered in euery vertuous and prudent action, teaching with al that who soeuer fayleth in any of the said circumstances,<note place="margin">Idem li. 6.</note> is not vertuous, nor by consequent prudent,<note place="margin">Ethic. e. 12.

                  <hi>The discipline of vvickednes is not vvisdome, nor the cogitations or plotts of sinners are not prudence.</hi> For seeing true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome consisteth in the feare of God and in the obseruation of his commandements (as I haue sufficiently proued) nothing that is offenciue to God, or contrary to his law, can stand with true wisdome. And againe seeing prudence and moral vertue are so connected, that they can not be seperated, yea and that not only the end of euery prudent action, but also the meanes must necessarily be good and vertuous (as I haue amply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) it must needes follow that whatsoeuer is vicious,<note place="margin">Supra. nu. 13.</note> impious, or wicked, is excluded from true prudence.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2397:184"/> policy; The one that no true policy can admit any impiety,<note place="margin">No true policy admitteth any impiety.</note> wickednes or offence of God. The other that al humane policy with out the light and help of Gods grace is vncertaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuous; And for the better vnderstanding hereof, it is to be considered, that as prudence is a part of wisdome,<note place="margin">Policy a part of prudence.</note> so policy is a part of prudence, and that prudence is also deuided into three partes. The first personal; the second Oeconomical; and the thirde political Personal prudence consisteth in the speculation and practise of such thinges, as belong only to particuler men:<note place="margin">Prudence diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>3</hi> parts.</note> Oeconomical prudence respecteth al thinges belonging to household;<note place="margin">VVhat is politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prudence or policy.</note> and political prudence is that which considereth matters pertaining to commonwelth; and this kind of prudence is properly called policy.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Therfore as prudence being a branch of wisdome, can not disagree from the nature therof (no more then the branch from the nature of the tree) so also policy being a part of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">Policy can not disagree from prudence.</note> must needs be conforme and agreeable therto (in which respect euery political act must needs be prudent, and euery pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent act concerning commonwelth, must needs be political) wherupon it followeth that seeing true prudence excludeth al wickednes and impiety, true policy doth also exclude the same.</p>
               <p n="38">38.<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> conclusiō.</note> And againe seeing true wisdome &amp; prudence are the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gifts of God (as I haue shewed) and that without the light and helpe of Gods grace,<note place="margin">Al humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy is vnperfect and defectuous vvithout the light of grace.</note> al humane wisdome is ful of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obscurity; vncertainty and error; it followeth also by the like consequence, that the like iudgment is to be giuen of al humane policy, to wit, that it is of it selfe imperfect, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, obscure, and erronious, and to be perfected, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, rectified and guided by the light of grace; which is the point that I haue specially laboured to proue throughout this whole Treatise.</p>

The one is of those who make no doubt to deale in matters of policy and state, without any care or regard of Gods helpe and assistance, yea with offence of God; wherby they expose not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2397:185"/> only the matters which they mannage to dangerous errors, and to al euil successe: but also the princes whom they councel, and the commonwelths where they gouerne, to Gods indignation, and consequently to vtter ruine, as I haue partly proued already in diuers parts of this Treatise, and wil proue more amply in the second part therof.</p>

The other sort of imprudent men, in my fancy are those, who are so farre transported either with a conceit of their owne witts and sufficiency, or with a desire to deale in great matters, that they aspire to nothing more, then to meddle in matters of state, yea and boldly embarke them selues in the greatest that doe occurre, before they haue any experience or practice therof in the world, or haue so much as reflected vpon the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of mans wit, and the weaknes of humane policy; or of the insuperable difficulties and dangers incident to matters of state, which are such as doe many tymes ouerthrow and disgrace the most wise and expert negociators.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And therfore it hapneth very often to those who so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and aduisedly seeke such employments,<note place="margin">VVhat hapneth to those vvhich vnaduisedly seeke great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</note> as it doth to a man, which in faire weather putteth him selfe to sea in a litle boat or fregot for his recreation, when vpon the suddaine there riseth a storme that carrieth him into the maine sea, and so tosseth him to and fro, that he not only looseth al the pleasure which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but also scapeth hardly with his life, and therfore with many a sigh and heauy groane he looketh back to the land from whence he came, but neuertheles is forced to goe whether the windes and tempests carry him, and perhaps perisheth in the end by the violence of the storme: and euen so (I say) it fareth many tymes with those which embarke them selues vnaduisedly in matters of state; for with in a while they finde them selues so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, that they desire to returne to their former repose and quietnes, but yet they are forced to goe whether the course and current of their affayres doth carry them, yea and sometymes perish amidst the manyfold dangers which commonly do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company state-matters, wherof the practise may wel be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the practise of phisicke.</p>

               <p n="2">2. As for that which toucheth him selfe; he is to regard cheefly eight points. The first is, that he procure by al meanes, not only to haue the reputation of vertue and religion, but also to be indeed truly vertuous and religious, for two causes: The first to obtaine therby the assistance of Gods grace, which how necessary it is for the illumination of mans vnderstandinge in al matters of councel, appeareth throughout this whole discourse, and especially in the 28. chapter, where I haue proued that true wisdome prudence and pollicy, are the special gifts of almighty God, and not otherwaies to be obtained but by the obseruation
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2397:193"/> of his commandements.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The other cause why it behoueth a councellour, to be truly religious and vertuous, is, for that such is the force of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that it giueth credit to the possessors therof, and maketh them more easely beleeued and their councel better accepted;<note place="margin">Vertue giueth reputation to the possessours of it.</note> and therfore we see that al men of discretion and iudgment doe demand councel rather of those who are reputed wise and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, then of wicked men who haue only reputation of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for as <hi>S.

               <p n="4">4. Furthermore such is the dignity and authority of vertue,<note place="margin">The dignity of vertu is such that euil men beare respect therto.</note> that euil men beare a reuerend respect therto, and stand, as it were, in awe of good men; wherof we haue an example in <hi>Herod,</hi> who although he held <hi>S.

                  </note> and no dout but wise and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous princes, much more esteeme and respect the councel of wise men that are vertuous, then of others of equal wit and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, that are vicious and wicked,<note place="margin">

               <p n="5">5. The second point is that he also giue satisfaction to the world of his wisdome, by the good and wise gouernment of his family; For no wise prince can thinke him a fit man to councel him, or to gouerne vnder him, that can not gouerne him selfe and his owne family, and therfore <hi>Basilius</hi> the emperour aduised his sonne to choose those for his councellours, who had giuen proofe and experience of their wisdome in the good conduct
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2397:194"/> and direction of their owne priuat affaires; Wherupon also <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> saith.<note place="margin">

The third point is, that in al his speaches and conference with his prince, he vse al sincerity, truth &amp; plainnesse, with out flattery; For although the common prouerb say; <hi>Obsequium ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, veritas odium parit, Flattery gaineth freends, and trueth hatred;</hi> Yet as there is nothing more pernicious to princes then flattery, so by consequent there is nothing more vnfit to be vsed of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, whose office is, and special care should be, to vndece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue their prince in al thinges, wherin they are any way decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to labour therin so much the more, by how much lesse other men doe it, seeing one of the greatest infelicities of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is,<note place="margin">

But when the time appointed for the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was expired, and <hi>Harold</hi> shewed no care to performe any part of his promises, the Duke sent messengers vnto him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of him the accomplishment therof, but he in steede of geuing satisfaction to the Duke, derided and abused his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, causing some of their horse tailes to be cutte of, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be lamed, and afterwards when King <hi>Edward</hi> died, he practised not only to exclude the Duke from the croune, but also procured it for him selfe, pretending that his promise to the Duke was made for feare, and that therfore it could not bynd him. And when the duke was entred into <hi>England</hi> with his army, and solicited him by messengers to haue care of his conscience, representing vnto him the seuere Iudgements of God vpon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured persons, offring to come to some reasonable composition
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2397:211"/> with him, he made no account therof, neither yet of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of his owne brother called <hi>Gurth,</hi> who aduised him seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously before the battaile to retire him selfe, and to leaue the conduct of the army vnto him, and others who were not bound to the duke by any oath or promise, lest other waise God might suffer them al to be ouerthrowne for his cause; whereto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he wold put it in venter and that God should be Iudge therof, &amp; so geuing battaile was slaine him selfe, &amp; al his army ouerthrowne, whereupon also followed the conquest of the cuntry. And although the said conquest might seeme to be a punishment of God vpon the whole realme for the sinnes of the people (as I haue amply declared before) yet the particuler disgrace which happened to King <hi>Harrolds</hi> person may wel be thought to haue proceeded of Gods iust iudgement for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, and so the English croniclers which wroote in that age,<note place="margin">Chap. 21. nu. 22.22. &amp; 23.</note> or neare that time doe signify, as <hi>Ingulphus, VVilliam</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now to come to the last point of my diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that is to say, what a councellour is to regard in the matter it selfe that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted; it is to be vnderstood, that although the affaires of state are infinit, and therfore can not be sufficiently reduced to particular rules; yet some things are generally to be considered in al matters what soeuer, wherof I wil here touch some such as occurre to me at this present.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First for a necessary preamble, or preparatiue to al delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in matters of state, it is to be considered, that in respect
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2397:215"/> of the connexion which particuler affaires of state,<note place="margin">Necessary for a councelour to knovv the state of forreine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> either haue or may haue, with the general state of forreine princes, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient &amp; necessary for a coūcellour to haue bene a trauiller, or otherwise to procure by al meanes to haue an exact knowledge and vnderstanding, not only of his owne princes state and affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but also of the estates &amp; affaires of other princes, especially of such as are his princes neighbours; enemies, or confederats.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To his end two thinges are requisite,<note place="margin">A counsellour should be affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; courteous to strangers and vvhy.</note> that he be affable and courteous towards al men, and willing to heare them, and to conferre with them, especially strangers, for that he may le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne by them many thinges, more then otherwise he can come to know, of the state of forrayne princes and countries. For as the Spanish prouerb saith; <hi>Mas sabe el necio en su casa, que el cuerdo en la agena; A foole knoweth more in his owne howse, then a wise man doth in another mans.</hi> And although a councellour may perhaps by this facility be many tymes troubled whith impertinent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet he shal withal vnderstand many thinges, which may import him to know, and there is no man so wise, but he may sometymes heare of a simple man, somwhat that may serue him to very good purpose; and therfore the trouble in this case is to be borne with patience, in respect of the benefit that he may reape therby.</p>
               <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">A councelour ought to procure frequent intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence out of forrayne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes and of vvhat matters.</note> The other thinge necessary for a councellours better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is to procure frequent aduises, and intelligence by lettres from al partes, of the state, humours, and dispositions of forrayne princes; of al changes and innouations in their courts and countryes; of the marriages and alliances of them, their children, and their most powerful subiects; of embassages to and fro, and their treatyes, of prouisions and preparations for warre, by sea and land, and their intentions therin; of al taxes and impositions laid vpon the people, or other leuies of money, of the diuisions that fal out amongst the nobility, or common people, of their discontentments; and fynally of al matters that may tend, either to the establishment &amp; strengthning, or to the weakning or innouation of other princes states. For although a councellour shal by this meanes heare many vntruths: yet he shal very oft receiue aduise of important matters,<note place="margin">VVhat benefit a councellour shal reape by frequēt intelligence.</note> wherof he may make good vse and benefit, and being a man of iudgment,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2397:216"/> and hauing intelligēce with many he may easely discerne truths from falshoods, by conferring their aduises togeather, especially if he take order that his intelligencers doe not know one of an others employment. Finally, he shal by this meanes, not only iudge better, and more clearly of al matters occurring for his princes seruice; but shal also make him selfe much more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his prince, by his dilligence, and more intrinsecal with him by the occasion of his frequent aduises of forreyne newes, which princes are alwayes most desierous to heare: And thus much for the first point.</p>

                  </note>5. Secondly a councellour is to consider that in al matters of councel, three thinges are specially to be respected; (as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> noteth following <hi>Aristotle</hi>) the first a due end; the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meanes, and the third fit tyme and season; that is to say, that the end and meanes be not only lawful, iust, and honorable in them selues, and in their owne natures; but also conuenient, and proportionable as wel one to another, as also to the person, state, and power of the prince: for if ther be any inconuenience, or disproportiō in any of these, I meane if the meanes be not cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the obtayning of the end, or if the end or meanes be impossible, or aboue the might and power of the prince, or base, or any way vnfit for his state and person, or if the councel be guien out of due tyme and season, especially to late, it looseth al grace, and cannot be accompted either good or prudent.</p>

                  </note>6. To this purpose I say, that according to <hi>Platoes</hi> rule, he, who is to giue his opinion of any matter whatsoeuer, ought first to vnderstand &amp; know fully the state therof with al the circū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. For mans iudgement is grounded vpon his knowledge and guided therby, and some one litle circumstance vnknowne, may wholy alter the case, and cause great errour in the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in so much that a simple man who knoweth more of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may iudge more wisely therof then a far wiser man that knoweth lesse; And the reason why wise men doe not alwayes iudge with like wisdome and prudence in al causes, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, because they doe not vnderstand them alike.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to proceede; the state and circumstances of the matter being once fully knowne to the councellour, he his then to passe to the consideration of the inconueniencies, difficultyes,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2397:216"/> dangers, discommodityes and commodities therof, which may minister different arguments, <hi>pro et contra,</hi> in the discussion and decission wherof the prudēce of a councellour is specially seene.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And here I note by the way (though perhaps, I may seeme somwhat to digresse from the matter) that some men which haue great viuacity and sharpnes of wit to find out inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to foresee dangers, and to propound obiections, douts,<note place="margin">The difference that may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ability of councellours.</note> and difficultyes, haue not maturity of iudgement to cleare and decyde them, or to find out remedyes; and that some other who are more mature and sound in iudgement, are lesse sharpe of wit: &amp; againe that some who are of good capacity, haue so litle cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that they are dismayed with euery difficulty, and therfore cannot easely resolue vpon any thing; wheras some others of lesse capacity, &amp; more courage resolue far more easely and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any occasion, so that we may say with the poet; <hi>Non omnia possumus omnes; VVe cannot al doe al thinges.</hi>

                  </note> And therfore <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> obserueth very wel, that it is conuenient for princes to haue many councellours, to the end that one of them may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defects of another; <hi>For the wisest</hi> (saith hee) <hi>erre oft tymes, either through passion, or through hate, or affection, or through the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their persons, especially after dinner, and if any</hi> (saith he) <hi>thinke that such ought not to be made counsellours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Al councellours erre at one tyme or other.</note>
                  <hi>it may be answered that vve are al men, and that vvhosoeuer wil haue none to bee of a princes councel, that erre at any time in speach or opinion, or are otherwhiles moued and led with passion, or affection, he must seeke them in heauen, for in earth none such are to be found.</hi> Thus saith he, who was him selfe a graue and wise councellour; which I note here by the way to the end that young councellours may learne, neither to assure them selues ouermuch of their owne opinions, nor rashly to condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their follow-counsellers, if they erre and be deceaued sometimes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And to prosecute this digression yet a litle further,<note place="margin">
                     <p>A princes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ought to be composed of men of different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>

                  </note> I also adde that it is necessary for a prince to haue his councel compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed like mans body, that is to say, of men of different complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and humours, to the end that the cholericke heate and hasty feruor of some, may be tempered with the flegmatick coldnes and slow resolution of some other; and that the viuacity of some mens sanguine spirits, and eleuated wits, may be some what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2397:217"/> and counterpoysed with the maturity of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers melancholike iudgments (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> holdeth to be foundest in matters of state) wherby the whole body of the coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel may be reduced to a perfect temperature,<note place="margin">Aristot. problem.

This I haue thought good to touch by the way that the young counceller whom I aduise, may vnderstand some what as wel of the nature of a councel, as of the office and duty of a councellour.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But now to retourne to the consideration of matters to be consulted, it is requisite that a counceller doe prudently waygh, and compare the discommodities with the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and inconueniences with the remedies, the difficulties, and dangers with the possibility, and probability to ouercome them; and not to reiect a very commodious and honorable desynment because it is costly, or some way discommodious or difficult and hard, or some way dangerous; for as the prouerb saith. <hi>There is no commodity vvithout a discommodity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No commodity vvithout a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity.</note>
                  <hi>nor any thing honorable vvhich is not difficult;</hi> And therfore it is to be foreseene, and prouided that the commodities ouerwaigh the dammages, that the gaine quite the cost, that euery inconuenience haue a due remedy, that euery difficulty be some way facilitated,<note place="margin">VVhat is to be forseene &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for in euery matter.</note> that euery im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant danger may be probably preuented or escaped; that of commodities which cannot be had togeather, the greater be chosen, and of inconueniences, when al cannot be auoyded, the least be admitted; al which being foreseene and probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, any important action whatsoeuer my be determined, councelled, and vndertaken, notwithstanding that some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and dangers may be incident therto. For he that wil not take paynes to crack the nut,<note place="margin">He that vvil hazard nothing shal vvinne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> cannot eate the kernel, and he that wil hazard nothing, shal winne nothing; <hi>For nought venture</hi> (saith the prouerb) <hi>nought haue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Yet this is to be vnderstoood, that the danger be not ouer
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2397:217"/> great; which may partly be prouided for, if it be foreseene,<note place="margin">
                     <p>VVhat is to be considered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning danger and the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof.</p>

                  </note> that the greatest danger rather concerne some circumstance of the matter, then the principal parte, or the whole body of the plot, that the benefit expected, doe farre exceede the losse or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which may be feared; that no certaine thing of moment be left or aduentured for a thing vncertaine (for <hi>better one bird in the hand then two in the bush</hi>) that of matters doubtful which can not fully be resolued, the lesse doubtful or more assured be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and finally that the hope of benefit be grounded vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reason, and sufficiente meanes to atcheiue the same, and not vpon chance, which is so vncertaine that no man may safely build any important matter theron. And therefore <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> held it for a ground of state, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witnesseth. <hi>Non omittere caput rerum, neque se in casum dare;</hi>

                  <hi>That a womans councel is neuer good but vpon a sudden;</hi> For when women councel according to their first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may councel fortunatly, either by chance, or by some natural impulse or motion; wheras falling to discourse of reason or to deliberation, they seldom or neuer coūcel wisely, through the infirmity and weaknes of their iudgement.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And to this purpose <hi>Aristotle</hi> alleadgeth the old prouerb; <hi>Fortuna fauet fatuis; Fortune fauoreth fooles,</hi> as I haue signified<note n="*" place="margin">ca. 12. nu. 2.</note> before, where I haue spoken somewhat of this point.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Nothing to be left to chance but in case of necessity.</note>14. Hereupon I conclude two thinges; the one that except in case of necessity, a wise man ought to leaue nothing to chance that may be any way assured by reasonable meanes, in respect of the danger thar may ensew therof; For although dangerous coūcells grounded vpon hope of good fortune, speed wel some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by meere chance, yet they proue most commonly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The other conclusion is, that seeing men are many times put to such sudden extremities, that they haue no time or opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to aduise themselues,<note place="margin">The necessity of the dayly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of our actions to God.</note> or sufficiently to consult with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is most necessary that they arme and prouide them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues against the same by frequent praier and by daily recomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of al their actions to almighty God, the author and giuer

               <p n="68">68. The third shal be to ponder and examine diligently not only the present state of the matter, and the immediate or next sequels therof, but also what may be like to succeed from time to time, and especially what may be the conclusion or (as I may tearme it) the vpshot of the whole; For many times it falleth out that designments prosper and succeed wel for a while, and ouerthrow the authors and attempters in the end,<note place="margin">The ouer sight of some coūcellours.</note> not so much by fortune or chance, as by ouersight of the councellour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer therof, who being deceaued with the appearance or hope of some present or neare commodity, foreseeth not, or else ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth some future and final disgrace:<note place="margin">Some improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent coūcellours compared to sick men.</note> much like to the sick man, who following his owne appetit, eateth or drinketh some thinge which refresheth and contenteth him for the present, and augmenteth his desease or killeth him in the end. In this point al wicked and machiauellian councells faile for the most part, which doe often succeede wel for a tyme through Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (for secret causes knowne to his diuyne wisdome) but in the end doe destroy princes and their states,<note place="margin">VVherin al vvicked or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauillian coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels fayle for the most part.</note> partly through the iustice of almighty God, and partly by errour of the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellours in true reason of state, as I hope to proue substantially and amply in the 34. and 35. chapter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the meane tyme I adde for the present a fourth cōside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the same purpose, to wit,<note place="margin">Commodity to be vvayed vvith stability and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</note> that a wise councellour ought to waigh the commodity of euery thinge with the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and security therof, and not to aduise his prince with a few yeres, present pleasure, or benefit, to purchase many yeres future payne or discommodity; but rather to endure some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage or dammage for a tyme, when therby he may attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to some stable and permanent good afterwards; which he may learne by the course that nature holdeth in humane and worldly affayres, ordayning motion for rest, buisnes for repose,<note place="margin">The course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation of matters of state.</note> labour for ease, and payne for pleasure.

This I say not only nature, but also true wisdome (which alwayes followeth the course &amp; steps therof) doth teach vs no lesse in matters of state, then in al other humane affaires.</p>
               <p n="17">17.

In the first case although neither good, nor bad policy,<note place="margin">VVhat maie be the effect of good, or bad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, vvhen God doth absolutly determine to destroy a state.</note> nor yet prayer can conserue the state (I meane when God doth absolutly determine to destroy it) yet it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that wicked policy may through the seuerity of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice accelerat, &amp; agrauate the calamity threatned, wheras good policy ioyned with cōfidence in God, &amp; pure deuotiō may moue his deuine maiesty to execute his Iudgements with much more mercy, and to turne al the temporal affliction of the prince to his eternal good, which in that case were the greatest benefite that could be desired, as I wil declare furder after awhile.<note place="margin">Infra. nu. 31.32. &amp; 33.</note>

In the second case (I meane when God doth absolutly determine to conserue a state) it is not to be douted but that wicked policy may be a meanes therof by Gods permission, and for the execution of his secret Iudgements, though neuertheles the prince that should practise the same should commit noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious folly, for that he might in that case maintaine his state by lawful, and good policy, with lesse danger, and much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to him selfe. And this I saye, because God vseth many times the wicked policies of men for the conseruation of states (when his absolute wil is to maintayne them) which neuertheles he wold conserue by the meanes of their lawful and good policies, if the fault were not in them selues. To which purpose it is to be vnderstood that almighty God, hauing geuen freedome of wil to man (for such causes as I haue declared in the 24.<note place="margin">Nu. 4.5.6.7. &amp;c.</note> chap;) doth not necessitat, or force mans wil, but vseth it such as it is, (as I haue diuers times signified) mouing it alwayse to good, and yet seruing him selfe of it be it good or bad, for his owne glory, and the accomplishment of his wil.</p>
